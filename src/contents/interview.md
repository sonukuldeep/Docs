### What is Reactjs?

React is a declarative, efficient, flexible open source front-end JavaScript library developed by Facebook in 2011. It follows the component-based approach for building reusable UI components, especially for single page application. It is used for developing interactive view layer of web and mobile apps. It was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. It was initially deployed on Facebook's News Feed section in 2011 and later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram.

## What are the features of React?

React framework gaining quick popularity as the best framework among web developers. The main features of React are:

- JSX
- Components
- One-way Data Binding
- Virtual DOM
- Simplicity
- Performance

### Can web browsers read JSX directly?

- Web browsers cannot read JSX directly. This is because they are built to only read regular JS objects and JSX is not a regular JavaScript object
- For a web browser to read a JSX file, the file needs to be transformed into a regular JavaScript object. For this, we use Babel

### What is the virtual DOM?

DOM stands for Document Object Model. The DOM represents an HTML document with a logical tree structure. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects.

React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in the memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM. When the state of an object changes, the virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects. The following are some of the most frequently asked react interview questions.
